## Packages
<br/>

Our flagship product `WISERP` can be configured and acquired as a `Package` to fit your specific needs. 

`Packages` are composed of `Apps`, `Apps` are modules that can be interrelated like Sales, Purchase & Inventory. When having a sale of an item, the inventory of that item will decrease. Conversely the inventory will increase if there is a purchase of that item. See [WISERP Basics](https://wiserp-ph.github.io/wiserp/wiserp_basics) for more info.
