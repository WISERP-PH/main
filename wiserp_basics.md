## WISERP Basics

### **BUSINESS APPS: Buy & Sell**

- Imagine a retail business where it buys the products from their suppliers and sells in retail to their customers.
- Here is a scenario where a business needs to buy some products if not all, in order to complete a particular sale to their customer.
- **NOTE** all of the columns are representative of the `Apps` themselves except for the `Marketing` which is actually a `CRM` (Customer Relationship Managment) app

①  `CRM` (Marketing) app generates leads. With the leads, Salesperson can use them to make a sale. Then `Sales Order` can be created for the products to sell. 

②  Using the `Sales Order`, if the products is short of stocks a replenishment is necessary. `Purchase Order` can be generated for the supplier. 

③  Upon the arrival of the ordered products (Receipts), inventory will get updated. 

④  At this point stocks has been replenished so sale can proceed in step ①, and orders can be delivered.

⑤  Using the purchase order, Vendor Bills can be generated to pay the suppliers.
