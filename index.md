WISERP PH was founded on September 15, 2020, by college platoonmates Ian TP. and Ray LP. through FB 
messenger. They brought to WISERP a vision of changing the way people viewed business apps.

starting from Negros Island. Believing that each SME deserves to be competitive in their respective
fields and in the global E-Business arena.
