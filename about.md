### The Liftoff 

```
Vanguard Digital Bacolod (VDB) was initiated on September 15, 2020 with a vision of changing the way 
people view business apps and software. The goal is to make digitization affordable for all SMEs 
(Small and Medium-sized Enterprise) starting from Negros island. Believing that each SME deserves 
to be competitive in their respective fields both in local and global possibilities.
```

We make sure that it is not about us. It is about the community that we serve.
```

Promote adoption of software and digital transformation among SMEs; as an advantage to empower their 
businesses, in Bacolod and beyond.

```
Increase tech awareness and activities in the community; and make Metro Bacolod the IT capital of the
Philippines.

We see a future of digitally empowered Filipino SMEs capable of competing globally.
